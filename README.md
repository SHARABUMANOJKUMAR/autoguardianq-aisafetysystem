---

## 🏆 Overview
**AutoGuardian Q-AI** is a futuristic, real-time **accident prevention platform** designed for **connected vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs)**.  
The system proactively detects vehicle failure risks **before accidents occur** and guides drivers with **instant voice-based safety actions**, powered by a **Multi-Agent AI architecture** and **Quantum-Inspired decision optimization**.

> 🎯 **Mission:**  
> Reduce road accidents in real time by predicting mechanical failure risks early and enabling drivers to take safe actions before danger occurs.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement
A significant number of road accidents are caused by:
- Sudden brake failures
- Tire bursts
- Engine overheating
- EV battery instability
- Delayed or ignored warning signals

Existing vehicle systems are **reactive**, alerting drivers **after** a failure becomes critical.  
There is a strong need for a **real-time, intelligent, and proactive safety system** that prevents accidents **before they happen**.

---

## 💡 Solution Summary
AutoGuardian Q-AI continuously monitors vehicle health data, analyzes risk in real time, and automatically:
- Detects abnormal behavior using AI
- Optimizes safety decisions using quantum-inspired logic
- Alerts drivers via voice and visual cues
- Recommends or triggers emergency safety actions
- Provides anonymized safety insights to manufacturers

This transforms predictive maintenance into a **life-saving accident prevention system**.

---

## 🧠 System Architecture (Multi-Agent Design)

The platform is built as a **Multi-Agent System**, where each agent has a clear responsibility:

### 🔹 Agents Overview
- **Sensor Agent** – Simulates real-time vehicle sensor data
- **AI Risk Analysis Agent** – Detects anomalies & computes risk score
- **Quantum-Inspired Optimization Agent** – Selects safest action among multiple options
- **Driver Communication Agent** – Issues real-time voice & visual alerts
- **Service Coordination Agent** – Handles emergency service booking
- **Manufacturer Insights Agent** – Provides anonymized safety analytics
